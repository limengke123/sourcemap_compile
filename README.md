## 🚀 Deployment

### Automatic Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Go to `Settings` → `Pages`
   - Under "Source", select `GitHub Actions`

2. **Push to main branch** - The workflow will automatically:
   - ✅ Install dependencies
   - ✅ Build the project
   - ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages

3. **Access your site** at:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/sourcemap_compile/
   ```

**Manual Trigger:**

You can also manually trigger the deployment by going to:
- `Actions` tab → `Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages` → `Run workflow`

The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## 📖 How to Use

### Step 1: Upload SourceMap Files

You can upload SourceMap files in three ways:

- **Drag & Drop**: Drag `.map` files directly onto the upload area
- **Directory Upload**: Drag an entire folder containing SourceMap files
- **ZIP Archive**: Upload a ZIP file containing multiple SourceMap files

### Step 2: Enter Error Stack Trace

Paste your error stack trace into the input field. The tool supports various formats:

**Standard Error Format:**
```
Error: Something went wrong
    at Object.fn (http://example.com/bundle.js:1:100)
    at main (http://example.com/bundle.js:2:200)
    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (http://example.com/bundle.js:3:300)
```

**Simple Stack Format:**
```
at http://example.com/file.js:10:5
at http://example.com/utils.js:25:15
```

### Step 3: Parse & View Results

Click the **"Parse Stack Trace"** button and watch as the tool:

- 🔍 Analyzes each stack frame
- 📍 Maps minified locations to original source code
- 📋 Displays file paths, line numbers, and column numbers
- 🎯 Highlights the exact error location

### Step 4: Copy Results

Use the **"Copy All"** button to copy the entire parsed stack trace for easy sharing or documentation.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 🐛 **Debug Production Errors** - Quickly locate bugs in production without source maps in the browser
- 📊 **Error Reporting** - Parse error reports from monitoring tools
- 🔧 **Code Review** - Understand error context during code reviews
- 📝 **Documentation** - Generate readable error reports for team members

## 📋 Supported Formats

- ✅ Individual `.map` files
- ✅ Multiple `.map` files (directory upload)
- ✅ ZIP archives containing `.map` files
- ✅ Standard JavaScript error stack traces
- ✅ Chrome DevTools stack traces
- ✅ Node.js error stack traces
